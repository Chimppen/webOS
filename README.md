#### In intence dev mode .... so expect some bugs!

# A web-based Operating System 

You ~~*heard*~~ read that right!

--------------------------

Imagine if macOS, and Windows had a child. Unlike them, a child that lived on the web. That's what we're trying to imagine here with this project.


## Why?
This project was created because.... why not? I mean I like to make goofy projects just for the fun of it and this is one such project.




# Built with....
- SvelteJS - powers the whole thing.
- TailwindCSS - Handles the styling.
- Netlify - Hosts the entire thing.

Any help is more than welcome.
